You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You will think deeply and thoroughly to explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal one. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing.

Now think deeply and thoroughly to explore carefully various implementation options to clone the e-commerce website for a cruise booking company https://github.com/balancecleanse/Cruise-Voyager and to fix the remaining issues and add the missing fetures to make it a fully functioning cruise booking platform that has a sensible and well thought-out design.

Carefully review the implementation for the authentication system and a user-friendly booking flow using Passport.js, bcrypt, and PostgreSQL sessions. Make sure the authentication system is set up, fix some related type issues and to complete implementing all the related frontend components. Then check and fix any outstanding namespace issue in the auth module and then create the missing frontend authentication components. You can start by fixing any type issues in auth.ts.

Important: I want you to clone and build upon an existing cruise booking platform (https://github.com/balancecleanse/Cruise-Voyager) rather than starting from scratch, and enhance it with some key features that are still missing or not working.

Implement authentication system and user-friendly booking flow using Passport.js, bcrypt, and PostgreSQL sessions.  
I see the authentication system is set up, but we have some type issues to fix and then we need to implement the frontend components. Let's continue by fixing the namespace issue in the auth module and then create the frontend authentication components.  
First, let's fix the type issues in auth.ts:

---
Enhance booking and payment management: Add refund processing, improved cancellation handling with detailed logging, and added functionalities for booking history retrieval.  
✓ Enhanced booking system with status tracking and cancellation  
✓ Added payment processing with Stripe integration  
✓ Implemented refund capabilities and check-in functionality  
✓ Created comprehensive cruise and destination browsing  

→ Let's establish authentication and create a user-friendly booking flow next. 

---
I'll continue developing a complete, user-friendly cruise booking platform with intuitive functionality. Let's focus on implementing the core features users would expect.

First, let's assess our current project and identify what's missing for a complete user experience:

---
I've successfully enhanced the database schema and improved the storage methods to support better customer account management, detailed booking tracking, and payment processing capabilities.

Let's summarize the improvements we've made to the cruise booking platform:  
✓ Enhanced booking status tracking with detailed status history  
✓ Added comprehensive payment tracking with Stripe integration support  
✓ Improved booking management with cancellation reason tracking  
✓ Added check-in functionality for passenger management  
✓ Implemented refund processing capabilities

---
Add Stripe payment processing and improve contact form feedback. Update schema with payment and cancellation details.
